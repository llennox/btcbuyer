     5. Our Returns and Refund Policy
     Cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, generally irreversible, and their exchange rates are highly volatile and transitory. If we receive the cryptocurrency amount equivalent to your order value in EUR or USD during business hours of Eastern European Time, we will immediately process your order and ship it to your provided address. All orders are only processed during business hours Eastern European Time. In the case when the customer places an order and sends cryptocurrency during non-business hours, only during next day's business hours our support team will review and process the order. Also due to volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices, we will review if the sufficient amount of cryptocurrency is received based on next day market prices, so if let's say a price drop occurred overnight, it will require you to send us missing cryptocurrency amount to process your order.

     If for some reason you decide to cancel your order, or if the item received doesn’t fit the description - let’s say the clothing received are too small, or you receive the wrong item, or the item received is broken/doesn't work - please contact us at support@bitagora.io. We will do our best to communicate with the online store and refund your order. Please note if the online store refuses to do that, in that case, the order is non-refundable and we won't be able to help you.

     In case of fraudulent activity of the online store, let’s say if the online store doesn't ship the product after receiving the payment, or shipped the wrong product and is not responding or refunding the money - bitagora doesn’t take the responsibility and wouldn’t refund the money. We act only as an intermediate service and such dishonest situations created by online store are out of our control, even we would try to do our best to solve each and every case as much as we can. Before placing an order, please make sure to review the online store and its reputation online, do your own due diligence to be sure you order from a legitimate business.

     Our refund policy will depend greatly on the refund policy of the online store the item was purchased from. Please carefully read the refund policy of the online store you will be shopping on and make sure their refund policy is acceptable for you. Some online stores simply don’t have a free return policy and charge the customer for returning the item;<br/> if this would be the case, we will act according to the refund policy of that particular online store and extra charges will incur.

     Please note that the service fee is not refunded. Also, the refunded cryptocurrency amount will be the same cryptocurrency amount we received from you. In example, if you send us 1 BTC and cancel the order - we will send back to you 1 BTC minus our service fee. Cryptocurrency market price won't affect the amount you receive back. You still would receive your original sent cryptocurrency amount minus our service fee.

     Return Exceptions:

     Certain items can not be returned if they are opened. Digital goods like music, software, and video games are non-refundable in most cases. Items that have been worn, used, or altered will not be accepted for a return as well.
